## Description of the App
This app is developed with Vue JS (Version 2). For CSS Framework, Vuetify is used. Vuex is used as a state management tool. For content representation, data from a local JSON file is used. Data used in this app is not persistent. For persistency, data can be stored in local storage or Session Storage with the help of Vuex. As no tool/mechanism is used for persistency,
reloading the browser will retain the initial state of the original data.
